# Brainstorm » Features & Layout Ideas

This file captures concrete ideas to shape the demo rebuild.

## Core pages / sections (single-page demo)
- Header: logo left, nav right, mobile hamburger.
- Hero: bold headline, short mission statement, CTA buttons (Get Involved / Events).
- What we do: 3–4 cards with icons or photos (Food Assistance, Community Events, Youth Programs, Volunteering).
- Upcoming events: small card list with dates.
- Volunteer / Donate CTA band » prominent full-width section.
- Testimonials or numbers: quick stats (families helped, volunteers, events/year).
- Contact: simple form + contact details.

## Interaction ideas
- Smooth scrolling navigation.
- Subtle hover/focus on cards and buttons.
- Mobile menu slide-in with focus trap (basic toggle for demo).
- Lazy-load images.

## Content strategy
- Short, scannable copy.
- Clear CTAs: Volunteer, Donate, Contact, View Events.
- Use existing logos and imagery from `images/`.

## Wireframe (top → bottom)
- Header
- Hero
- Quick stats strip
- Services grid
- Events list
- Volunteer CTA
- Contact
- Footer

## Small experiments (optional)
- Lightweight CSS animation for hero background gradient.
- Print styles for contact info.
- Dark mode toggle as optional feature.

## Constraints & assumptions
- This is a static demo (no backend). Contact form uses `mailto:` or client validation only.
- Use only the included images » avoid external image downloads.
