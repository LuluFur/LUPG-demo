Level Up Gosport has gained an excellent reputation within the local community for being reliable, friendly and hard-working – which is why the members are asked to return to support events and activities year-on-year.

Every fortnight the Level Up Gosport members meet up to chat about forthcoming events and activities; plus enjoy some time socialising in a safe, inclusive space.

Level Up Gosport provides specific training and workshops that are tailored to the additional needs of the members.

In the past these have included: Food Health & Hygiene; First Aid; Safeguarding; Social Media Awareness & Safety, plus many more…

We work alongside the local community to develop volunteering opportunities for the members to participate in – and have received some excellent feedback from the organisers and local people…

“Level Up Gosport are an incredibly well-respected organisation who are passionate and caring about helping others whilst building their confidence and self-esteem. They were always willing to step in and help with Mayoral events helping to raise money for local charities. In the following years after being Mayor it has been a pleasure to see the team always active in many community events around the Borough.

Level Up Gosport are extremely community focussed and raise awareness of the diversity among people in our society and the wide range of issues that affect them, whether they relate to disability, mental health, confidence or culture, and to show that there is a role for everyone. The group’s philosophy is that no matter what the circumstances of a young person’s life, we are all valuable.” Cllr John Beavis: MBE – Mayor of Gosport 2013/14

We have an allotment where the members learn all about planting, nurturing and harvesting vegetables.  They are aiming to make it 100% sustainable and really enjoy interacting with the other allotment owners.
We arrange social outings whereby the members get the chance to chill out and just have fun.  Previously the members have enjoyed a warm, sunny evening playing rounders, alongside a picnic or BBQ.  Level Up Gosport listens to our members requests for social activities and provides the events that our members want. 
Many members make friends for life and choose to arrange to socialise away from Level Up Gosport, in their free time – going to events, shopping or just chilling out at home. 
Our members are very supportive towards one another – helping new young people who have become members to feel at ease and comfortable; plus supporting them at volunteering activities until they feel confident enough to volunteer without support.

Each year our members, volunteers and staff organise an Awards Evening, where prominent people, local dignitaries, organisations, charities supported by the members, plus friends and family from the local community attend and present the Level Up Gosport members with their achievement awards, certificates and small gifts.

A buffet of delicious food is provided and the evening usually finishes with some dancing.  It is an event that is very much anticipated by our members and is very well-attended.  

Level Up Gosport offers the chance for our members to work alongside with other charities and organisations – helping to create networking opportunities that will support the members in their future endeavours.
